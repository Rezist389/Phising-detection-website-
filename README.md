# Phishing URL Detection 
  Phishing URL detection is the process of identifying suspicious or potentially dangerous links or URLs sent via email, text message, or social media with the aim of obtaining the victim's personal or financial information. The goal of this detection is to prevent victims from losing their personal and financial information to fraudsters. In detecting phishing URLs, link analysis involves checking links to see if they point to fake or suspicious websites. This application uses the KNN (K-Nearest Neighbors) Classifier algorithm.
